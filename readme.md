Ruby Calculator
This project is a simple command-line calculator written in Ruby. It allows the user to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program runs in a continuous loop until the user decides to exit.

How to Run the Project
To run this project, you will need to have Ruby installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to execute the calculator:

Install Ruby: If you don't already have Ruby installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

Clone the Repository: If this project is in a Git repository, clone it to your computer. Otherwise, you can copy the provided code and paste it into a file with a .rb extension, for example, calculator.rb.

Run the Script: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the Ruby file is located, and run the following command:

bash
Copy
ruby calculator.rb
Use the Calculator: After running the script, the calculator menu will be displayed. You can choose an operation by typing the corresponding number and following the instructions to input the numbers. To exit the calculator, type 0 when the menu is displayed.

Features
The calculator offers the following operations:

Addition: Adds two numbers.

Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.

Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.

Division: Divides the first number by the second.

Code Structure
The code is structured in a class called Operation, which contains methods for each of the mathematical operations. The main loop of the program allows the user to select an operation and input the necessary numbers to perform the calculation.

Example Usage
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the calculator:
